# Contributing

Please note we have a code of conduct, please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

### **We expect you to follow our parent organization standards, which can be found [here](https://github.com/interactions-py/library/blob/stable/CONTRIBUTING.rst)**

## Pull Request Process

Following our parent organization guidelines, our issue requirements are relaxed, whereas an 
issue is not required if you deem the feature or bugfix you wish to implement is small enough that
creating an issue would be considered excessive. Although, issues are very much encouraged to
exercise organization in the development ecosystem.

## Code of Conduct

### Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

### Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

when an individual is representing the project or its community.
